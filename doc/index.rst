Welcome to napari-imagej's documentation!
=========================================

napari-imagej aims to provide access to all `ImageJ2 <https://imagej.net/software/imagej2>`_ functionality through the `napari <https://github.com/napari/napari>`_ graphical user interface.

napari-imagej builds on the foundation of `PyImageJ <https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej>`_, a project allowing ImageJ2 access from Python.
