napari-imagej: ImageJ ecosystem access within napari
====================================================

The `napari <https://napari.org/>`_ application has brought n-dimensional image browsing and analysis to the Python ecosystem. At the same time, the ImageJ software ecosystem, including `ImageJ <https://imagej.net/ij/index.html>`_, `ImageJ2 <https://imagej.net/software/imagej2>`_, `Fiji <https://fiji.sc/>`_ and `thousands of community plugins <https://imagej.net/list-of-extensions>`_, have been curated over decades, and are utilized by a highly active community of their own.

The napari-imagej plugin strives to unite these communities by providing access to an ImageJ2 instance within a napari widget. From this widget, users can launch the ImageJ user interface to run **any** ImageJ ecosystem functionality, and can additionally access **ImageJ2** framework functionality directly from the napari widget.

napari-imagej handles the burdens of inter-language workflows, enabling accessible, synergistic workflows between the two applications.
