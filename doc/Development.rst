Developer's Guide
========================

This document describes how to contribute to the napari-imagej source.

If your goal is only to *use* napari-imagej to call ImageJ ecosystem routines in napari, see `this page <./Install.html>`_.

Configuring a Mamba environment for development
-----------------------------------------------

napari-imagej requires Java and Python components, and as such we *highly* recommend contributors use 
The first step towards development is installing napari-imagej from source. With Mamba_, this is particularly easy.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    git clone https://github.com/imagej/napari-imagej
    cd napari-imagej
    mamba env create -f dev-environment.yml

This virtual environment must then be activated to work on the napari-imagej source:

.. code-block:: bash

    mamba activate napari-imagej

Testing
-------

napari-imagej uses pytest_ to automate testing. By installing the developement environment above, ``pytest`` will come installed.

To test napari-imagej, simply run ``pytest`` on your command line.

Documentation
-------------

napari-imagej uses `Read the Docs`_ for user-facing documentation. If you make front-end changes to napari-imagej, please describe your changes with the files in the ``doc`` folder of the napari-imagej source.

Once you've made your changes, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    make docs

This will build the documentation into HTML files locally, stored in the ``doc/_build/html`` folder. You can then view the documentation locally by loading ``doc/_build/html/index.html`` in the browser of your choice.

Production documentation is available online at https://napari-imagej.readthedocs.io/

Formatting
----------

black_, flake8_, and isort_ are used to lint and standardize the napari-imagej source.

To manually format the source, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    make clean

napari-imagej also includes pre-commit_ configuration for those who want it. By using pre-commit, staged changes will be formatted before they can be commited to a repository. pre-commit can be set up using:

.. code-block:: bash

    pre-commit install

Building distribution bundles
-----------------------------

You can run the following to bundle napari-imagej

.. code-block:: bash

    make dist
