**napari-imagej** aims to provide access to all [ImageJ2] functionality through the [napari] graphical user interface. It builds on the foundation of [PyImageJ], a project allowing ImageJ2 access from Python.

See the [project roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/imagej/projects/2), still under construction.

You can find documentation and examples [here](https://napari-imagej.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## With napari-imagej, you can access:
* [ImageJ2 Commands] - 100+ image processing algorithms
* [ImageJ Ops] - 500+ *functional* image processing algorithms
* [SciJava Scripts] - migrated from Fiji or ImageJ2, or written yourself!

## Installing from Source

Currently, the only way to install napari-imagej is by downloading this repository. You can then use [conda]/[mamba] to install the environment.

First, **[install mamba]**. Then:

    git clone https://github.com/imagej/napari-imagej
    cd napari-imagej
    mamba env create
    mamba activate napari-imagej

We will be publishing a release of napari-imagej to [napari hub] and [PyPI] and [conda-forge] soon.

To start napari with napari-imagej, activate the conda environment and run `napari`:

    mamba activate napari-imagej
    napari

## Usage

### A simple example

With napari-imagej installed, you can access it through napari's `Plugins` menu. Clicking `napari-imagej` will show the main napari-imagej widget.

Once the napari-imagej widget has loaded, typing keywords into the searchbar will display results in the list below.

Selecting a result will show buttons at the bottom of the widget for executing that functionality. Of importance are the `Run` and `Widget` buttons, *both used to run the selected algorithm*:
* The `Run` button launches a *modal* dialog prompting the user for inputs. Clicking the `OK` button will run the functionality with the selected inputs.
  * Best choice for single function executions, as the dialog only persists for the single execution.
* The `Widget` button launches a *new napari widget* prompting the user for inputs. Clicking the `Run` button will run the functionality with the selected inputs
  * Best choices for experimentation, as the widget will persist until closed by the user.

### Running your own [SciJava Scripts]

napari-imagej is able to automatically detect and expose user-written SciJava scripts. To discover these scripts, they must be located in a *subdirectory* of a `scripts` directory relative to the location where napari is launched.

For example, we might write this SciJava script, named `scripts/examples/Connected_Components_Analysis.py`, in Jython:
```jython
#@ Img input
#@ OpService ops
#@output net.imglib2.roi.labeling.ImgLabeling segmentation

inverted = ops.run("copy.img", input)
ops.run("image.invert", inverted, input)

from net.imglib2.algorithm.labeling.ConnectedComponents import StructuringElement

thresholded = ops.run("threshold.otsu", inverted)

segmentation = ops.run("labeling.cca", thresholded, StructuringElement.FOUR_CONNECTED)
```
We can then run it in napari-imagej, **if napari is launched from the parent of the aforementioned `directory`**:

### Launching the ImageJ User Interface

napari-imagej provides the ability to interact with the ImageJ2 User Interface directly.

**This feature is only available when PyImageJ can be run [interactively](https://pyimagej.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Initialization.html#interactive-mode).**

Once napari-imagej has successfully started ImageJ, the ImageJ2 button at the top of the widget will become enabled. Pressing the button will launch the ImageJ2 GUI and will enable the other buttons in the menu.

* Clicking the right arrow button causes the *active* napari `Layer` to be transferred into ImageJ2.
* Clicking the left arrow button causes the *active* ImageJ2 `Dataset` to be transferred into napari. 

*If the user instead wishes to select the transferred layer from a list of available data, set `choose_active_layer` to `false` in the plugin settings.*

## Troubleshooting

### napari-imagej does not appear in the Plugins menu of napari!

[npe2] is a useful tool for validating a napari plugin's setup. When running napari-imagej from a [conda] environment, you can install npe2 through [conda-forge]:

    mamba activate napari-imagej
    mamba install npe2 -c conda-forge
    npe2 validate napari-imagej

If `npe2 validate` returns an error, this indicates that napari-imagej was not installed correctly.

### The search bar is disabled with the message "Initializing ImageJ..."

Since napari-imagej is calling Java code under the hood, it must launch a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM is not launched until the user starts napari-imagej. As we cannot search Java functionality *until the JVM is running*, the search bar is not enabled until the JVM is ready.

The first launch of napari-imagej can take significantly longer than subsequent launches while the underlying framework downloads the Java artifacts needed to run ImageJ2. **Downloading these libraries can take minutes**. These libraries are cached, however, so subsequent launches should not take more than a couple of seconds.

### The ImageJ2 GUI button is greyed out!

There are two common cases for a disabled ImageJ2 GUI button:

1. When napari-imagej is first launched, the button will be disabled until the ImageJ2 Gateway is ready to process data. Please see [here](#The-search-bar-is-disabled-with-the-message-"Initializing-ImageJ...")

2. On some systems (namely **MacOS**), PyImageJ can **only** be run headlessly. In headless PyImageJ environments, the ImageJ2 GUI cannot be launched. Please see [here](https://pyimagej.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Initialization.html#interactive-mode) for more information.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! When making changes to napari-imagej, please instead use a new conda environment derived from the file `dev-environment.yml`.

    mamba env create -f dev-environment.yml
    mamba activate napari-imagej-dev

The resulting environment `napari-imagej-dev` provides developer tools on top of the libraries needed to run napari-imagej. It **must be activated** for napari-imagej to appear in the Plugins menu. You can start napari *with napari-imagej* using the following:

    mamba activate napari-imagej-dev
    napari

**Once you've made changes**, please lint your code by running `bin/lint.sh`.

Finally, file a [pull request]!
